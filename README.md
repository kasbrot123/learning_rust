# Repository for learning Rust

Repository for learning rust, documentation..
I will try to write notes of the examples and what is the idea.


## Main Project

The main project will be a command line tool which can create plots in the terminal. Based on the idea from Jon G. I will try to achieve the same goal which is creating this tool and to learn rust.

### Similar Tools

Some tools how the final version should look like
- [Guff](https://github.com/silentbicycle/guff) (Video Jon G.)
- [YouPlot](https://github.com/red-data-tools/YouPlot) (very pretty!)
- [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) (also has terminal capabilities)

## Logs

Found the terminal tool youplot or `uplot`. Fantastic tool, it works with unicode characters and is really pretty. The ascii plots look horrible next to it. Some things I would change but this is personal preference. It works with ruby and some julia library (?). After this discovery it is completely useless to rewrite the whole thing in less performant/pretty code just have it in rust. But I want to learn rust and I give it a try.
