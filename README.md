Found the terminal tool youplot or `uplot`. Fantastic tool, it works with unicode characters and is really pretty. The ascii plots look horrible next to it. Some things I would change but this is personal preference. It works with ruby and some julia library (?). After this discovery it is completely useless to rewrite the whole thing in less performant/pretty code just have it in rust. But I want to learn rust and I give it a try.
